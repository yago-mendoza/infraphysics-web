# neural cellular automata

exploring self-organizing systems. unlike traditional cellular automata (like game of life), the update rule here is a small neural network.

the goal: can a texture "heal" itself if parts of it are erased?

results: yes, with sufficient training on the target image, the system creates a robust homeostasis.

the output is best observed through a [[UI//GUI]] — watching patterns emerge in real time.
