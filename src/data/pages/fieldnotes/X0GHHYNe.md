- Small single-board computer that runs a full OS (Linux); educational and prototyping platform
- Raspberry Pi (Broadcom [[trkh9gwv|SoC]]), [[HjOAbpcL|Jetson]] (NVIDIA [[58TuBQEb|Orin]] [[trkh9gwv|SoC]])
- Unlike a bare [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]], a microcomputer has enough [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] and storage to boot Linux and run user-space applications
