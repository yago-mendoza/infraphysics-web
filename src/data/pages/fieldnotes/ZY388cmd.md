Open-source [[Tj137ydg|latent diffusion]] model (Stability AI, August 2022). Text-to-image via [[pJmh7BBn|CLIP]] text encoder + cross-attention conditioning. The "Napster moment" for AI art — anyone could run it locally, fine-tune it, build on top. Spawned the entire ecosystem: ControlNet, LoRA image adapters, inpainting, img2img.
