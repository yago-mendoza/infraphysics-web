- [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] with a resin window over an array of photo-diodes
- Pipeline: light hits photo-diodes ⟶ [[6YzJQiig|ASIC]] ADC converts voltage to bits ⟶ 1.5 GB/s ⟶ [[trkh9gwv|SoC]] (ASIC image processing) ⟶ [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] (decoded colors) ⟶ screen
- The ADC and image signal processor ([[6YzJQiig|ASIC]]) sit directly below the sensor die
