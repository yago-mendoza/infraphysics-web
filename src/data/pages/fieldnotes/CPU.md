The central processing unit — the sequential instruction executor at the heart of every programmable system. Fetches, decodes, and executes one instruction stream per [[CPU//core]]. Arithmetic happens in the [[CPU//ALU]], operands live in [[CPU//register]] files, and shared-state coordination requires [[CPU//mutex]] primitives. In embedded contexts, the CPU is often an ARM core inside a [[chip//MCU]] or [[chip//SoC]].
