- Reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture licensed by Arm Holdings
- Dominates mobile, embedded, and increasingly server workloads due to power efficiency
- Unlike x86, ARM licenses its instruction set to third parties — [[trkh9gwv|SoC]] vendors like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung design their own cores around it
- Three main profile families target different compute tiers:
  + [[7wngT1lE|Cortex-A]] (Application) ⟶ [[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]]
  + [[9SciTeo3|Cortex-R]] (Real-time) ⟶ industrial, safety-critical
  + [[OQmzx1Vg|Cortex-M]] (Microcontroller) ⟶ [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]]
- [[q3TzzAYI|NVIDIA]] designs blueprints around ARM ⟶ [[ZzRsypXy|fab]]bed by TSMC ⟶ tiny black square
