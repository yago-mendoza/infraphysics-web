Espressif's Wi-Fi + Bluetooth [[chip//SoC]] family targeting IoT. Integrates dual-core [[CPU]] (Xtensa or RISC-V), [[RAM]], flash, radio, and [[peripheral]] blocks (ADC, SPI, I2C, PWM). Programmed via ESP-IDF (FreeRTOS-based) or Arduino. Popular for [[sensor//smart sensor]] gateways, home automation, and [[ML//TinyML]] edge devices. Low cost (~$2–5) makes it the default prototyping platform for connected hardware.
