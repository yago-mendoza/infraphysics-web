- STMicroelectronics' family of [[OQmzx1Vg|Cortex-M]] (and Cortex-A) based [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] and [[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]] devices
- STM32F4 and STM32H7 series are workhorses for embedded development
- Rich [[PrATEjcr|peripheral]] sets (ADC, DAC, timers, CAN, USB, Ethernet), mature tooling (STM32CubeMX, HAL drivers), and a massive community
- [[sNxMwfUX|firmware]] is typically C, compiled with GCC-ARM, and flashed via SWD/JTAG
- Standard MCU for anything: GPIO, Timers/PWM, ADC/DAC, I2C/SPI/UART
