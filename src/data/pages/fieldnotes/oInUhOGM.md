- The internal design of a [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] — streaming multiprocessors ([[q3TzzAYI|NVIDIA]]) or compute units (AMD) grouped into warps/wavefronts executing in lockstep
- Memory hierarchy includes registers, shared memory, L1/L2 caches, and high-bandwidth GDDR or HBM
- Architecture choices determine throughput for graphics, [[7aLJOACt|ML]] training, and scientific workloads
- [[LxUj37D3|discrete]] cards push bleeding-edge architectures; [[a2FkPabO|integrated]] units share die area with the [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]]
