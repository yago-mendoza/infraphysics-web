Input/output — the mechanisms through which a [[CPU]] communicates with the external world: storage, network, sensors, displays. Software triggers I/O via [[I/O//syscall]] (user-to-kernel boundary), while hardware uses [[I/O//MMIO]] (memory-mapped registers) or [[I/O//DMA]] (direct memory access bypassing the CPU). I/O latency often dominates real-world performance far more than raw compute speed.
