- The arithmetic logic unit — a combinational circuit inside a [[Z9W6rweD|core]]
- Performs integer addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR/XOR, and shifts
- Floating-point math typically lives in a separate FPU
- Modern cores have multiple ALUs executing in parallel, fed by the out-of-order scheduler
- Results are written back to a [[2S1PZjWY|register]]
