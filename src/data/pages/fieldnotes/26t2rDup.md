- Printed circuit board — fiberglass-and-copper substrate that mechanically supports and electrically connects [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] components via etched traces
- Design tools: KiCad, Altium
- Manufacturing involves layer stackup, drilling, plating, solder mask, and silkscreen
- A [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] or [[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]] sits on the PCB alongside passives (resistors, capacitors), connectors, and power regulation
- Board complexity ranges from 2-layer hobbyist to 20+ layer server motherboards
