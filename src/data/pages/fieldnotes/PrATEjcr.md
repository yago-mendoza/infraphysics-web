- External or on-chip hardware block that extends a processor's capabilities — timers, UARTs, SPI, I2C, ADC, DAC, PWM controllers
- In embedded development, peripherals are the interface between digital logic and the physical world
- Popular platforms like [[LR9wgzYo|STM32]] and [[xVyHlNQa|ESP32]] provide rich peripheral sets accessible via [[Yu2rpig0|MMIO]] registers
