- Second-pass model that re-scores retrieved documents for query relevance
- First pass ([[2CN85TFL|BM25]] or [[haA3MDhG|embeddings]]) retrieves candidates cheaply; reranker uses cross-[[ml8njOQc|attention]] to evaluate each pair
- Much more accurate than bi-encoder similarity but too slow for full-index search — hence the two-stage pipeline
