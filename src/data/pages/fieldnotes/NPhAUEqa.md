- In PoS, a random subset of validators is selected as the "attestation committee" for each slot
- Committee members vote ("attest") that they've seen and validated the proposed block
- Block becomes canonical when it receives >2/3 of committee votes
- Not all validators attest to every block — committees rotate to distribute the workload
