- A single, independent instruction execution pipeline within a [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]]
- Modern processors pack 4–128+ cores onto one die, each with private L1/L2 caches and shared L3
- Multi-core scaling requires careful synchronization via [[xESuHo5A|mutex]] primitives to avoid data races
- ARM big.LITTLE pairs high-performance [[7wngT1lE|Cortex-A]] cores with efficient ones for power-aware scheduling
- A core is roughly equivalent to a [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]]: it contains an [[egoxqpmC|ALU]], [[2S1PZjWY|register]]s, and an instruction decoder
