STMicroelectronics' family of [[ARM//cortex-M]] (and Cortex-A) based [[chip//MCU]] and [[chip//MPU]] devices. The STM32F4 and STM32H7 series are workhorses for embedded development — rich [[peripheral]] sets (ADC, DAC, timers, CAN, USB, Ethernet), mature tooling (STM32CubeMX, HAL drivers), and a massive community. [[manufacturing//firmware]] is typically C, compiled with GCC-ARM, and flashed via SWD/JTAG.
