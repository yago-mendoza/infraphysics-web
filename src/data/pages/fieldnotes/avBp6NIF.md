- Training models on outputs from other models. Bootstrapping knowledge.
- Risk of "model collapse" — errors compound across generations, diversity shrinks
- But carefully curated synthetic data (math proofs, code with verification) works well
- The uncomfortable question: what happens when most training data is AI-generated?
