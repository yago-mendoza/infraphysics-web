A device that converts a physical quantity (temperature, acceleration, light, pressure) into an electrical signal. Raw analog output is digitized by an ADC for processing. A [[sensor//smart sensor]] integrates signal conditioning and a local processor on one die. Sensors feed data to [[chip//MCU]] or [[chip//SoC]] platforms in IoT and industrial systems, and often connect via [[I/O//MMIO]] or serial buses.
