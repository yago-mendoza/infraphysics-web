- The central processing unit — the sequential instruction executor at the heart of every programmable system
- Fetches, decodes, and executes one instruction stream per [[Z9W6rweD|core]]
- Arithmetic happens in the [[egoxqpmC|ALU]], operands live in [[2S1PZjWY|register]] files
- Shared-state coordination requires [[xESuHo5A|mutex]] primitives
- In embedded contexts, often an ARM core inside a [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] or [[trkh9gwv|SoC]]
