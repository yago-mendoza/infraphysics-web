- Hierarchical Deterministic: one master seed → infinite key pairs in a reproducible tree
- Advantage over [[2HSHagKF|keystore]] files: one backup (the seed phrase) recovers ALL accounts
- Deterministic means the same seed always produces the same sequence of accounts — math, not randomness
- Cross-wallet compatible: same seed phrase in Metamask and Trust Wallet → same accounts, same balances
- After restore, only Account 1 shows — user must "Add Account" to re-derive the others in order

[[HzLb0Y6y|Seed Phrase]] :: the seed phrase is the human-readable form of the entropy that generates the master key
