A material whose electrical conductivity falls between a conductor and an insulator — most commonly silicon. By selectively doping regions with impurities, engineers create P-N junctions that form transistors, the fundamental switching elements of all digital and analog electronics. The [[manufacturing//fab]] process etches billions of these transistors onto wafers to produce [[chip]] dies. Moore's Law has driven exponential scaling for decades, pushing from micron-scale features to sub-3nm process nodes.
[[chip]] :: the primary product — billions of transistors patterned onto a silicon die
[[manufacturing//fab]] :: the photolithographic process that patterns circuits onto semiconductor wafers
[[ASIC]] :: application-specific chips optimized for a single workload at the transistor level
[[hardware]] :: semiconductors are the material foundation of all modern hardware
