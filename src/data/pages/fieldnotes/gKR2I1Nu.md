- Microcontroller unit — a self-contained [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] integrating [[Z9W6rweD|core]] (often ARM Cortex-M), flash memory, [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]], and [[PrATEjcr|peripheral]] blocks on a single die
- Peripherals on-die: timers, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C
- Runs bare-metal or RTOS code
- Examples: [[LR9wgzYo|STM32]] (STMicro), [[xVyHlNQa|ESP32]] (Espressif)
- Dominates IoT, automotive, and industrial control — cost, power, and determinism matter more than raw speed

[[trkh9gwv|SoC]] :: SoCs integrate GPU, NPU, and modem — MCUs focus on real-time control with minimal overhead
[[sNxMwfUX|firmware]] :: MCUs run firmware directly on bare metal or lightweight RTOS, no OS abstraction layer
