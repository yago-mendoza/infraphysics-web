- Facebook AI Similarity Search: Meta's open-source library for efficient similarity search on dense vectors
- Supports exact (brute-force), approximate ([[wV5gFH9z|HNSW]], IVF), and GPU-accelerated index types
- Product quantization (PQ) compresses vectors to dramatically reduce memory — search billions of vectors on one machine
- The reference implementation for vector search in research. Many production systems use FAISS internally
