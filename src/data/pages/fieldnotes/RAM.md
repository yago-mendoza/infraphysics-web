Random-access memory — volatile storage providing nanosecond-latency read/write for running programs. The operating system partitions physical RAM into [[RAM//kernel space]] (privileged, hardware-facing) and [[RAM//user space]] (application sandboxes). RAM bandwidth and latency dominate performance in data-intensive tasks — [[GPU//architecture]] addresses this with wide buses and high-bandwidth memory. Embedded systems often use SRAM on-chip inside a [[chip//MCU]].
