System-on-chip — a [[chip]] integrating [[CPU//core]] clusters, [[GPU]], [[ML//NPU]], memory controller, modem, and [[peripheral]] blocks onto a single die or package. Examples: Apple M-series, Qualcomm Snapdragon, NVIDIA Orin. SoCs dominate mobile and edge computing because tight integration reduces latency, power, and board area vs. discrete [[chip//MPU]] + [[GPU//discrete]] designs.
