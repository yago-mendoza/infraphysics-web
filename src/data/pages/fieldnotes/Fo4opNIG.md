- The rules for who creates the next block and how the network agrees it's valid
- PoW (deprecated): compete by mining hash puzzles — enormous energy waste
- PoA ([[chH7mwPq|Clique]]): authorized signers take turns — fast, efficient, permissioned
- PoS ([[7xWE1VgH|PoS]]): stake ETH, get randomly selected — energy efficient, open participation

[[chH7mwPq|Clique]] :: PoA for private/consortium networks
[[7xWE1VgH|PoS]] :: PoS for public networks like Ethereum Mainnet
