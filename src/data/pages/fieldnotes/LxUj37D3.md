- A standalone [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] on its own PCB with dedicated GDDR/HBM memory
- Connected to the host [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] via PCIe or NVLink
- Delivers maximum compute throughput for [[7aLJOACt|ML]] training, rendering, and HPC
- Power draw ranges from 75W (entry) to 700W+ (datacenter)
- Data must be explicitly transferred between host [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] and device memory; adds latency but offers massive bandwidth on-card
- Hand size; 450 W; for car cameras, heavier data streams, and datacenter workloads
