- Seed phrase restoration: install fresh wallet → import seed → all accounts re-derived deterministically
- Only Account 1 visible initially — user must "Add Account" to re-derive accounts 2, 3, etc.
- Recovery works on ANY compatible wallet (BIP-39/44) — not locked to a specific vendor
- The password is device-local — a new device gets a new password, the [[HzLb0Y6y|seed phrase]] stays the same

[[HzLb0Y6y|Seed Phrase]] :: the seed phrase is the single backup for everything — lose it and the wallet is unrecoverable
