- A small, ultra-fast storage cell inside the [[Z9W6rweD|core]] — typically 32 or 64 bits wide
- Holds operands for the [[egoxqpmC|ALU]], return addresses, stack pointers, and status flags
- ARM architectures expose 16–31 general-purpose registers; x86 has historically fewer, relying more on stack and memory
- Register pressure directly affects compiler optimization quality
