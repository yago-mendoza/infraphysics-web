- The physical layer of computing — circuits, boards, and systems that execute software
- Every abstraction in code ultimately resolves to electrons moving through [[hjMUh5ut|semiconductor]] materials
- A typical system stacks [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] dies onto [[26t2rDup|PCB]] boards
- [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] executes instructions, [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] handles parallel workloads, [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] provides volatile storage, [[QB8hS8Ts|storage]] persists data
- The boundary between hardware and software blurs as [[sNxMwfUX|firmware]] and [[6YzJQiig|ASIC]] designs encode logic that once lived in code
