- System-on-chip — a [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] integrating [[Z9W6rweD|core]] clusters, [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]], [[1yDGHLLU|NPU]], memory controller, modem, and [[PrATEjcr|peripheral]] blocks onto a single die or package
- Examples: Apple M-series, Qualcomm Snapdragon, NVIDIA Orin
- Dominates mobile and edge computing — tight integration reduces latency, power, and board area
- Vs. discrete [[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]] + [[LxUj37D3|discrete]] designs

[[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] :: MCUs trade integration breadth for determinism and cost — SoCs pack more IP but need an OS
[[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]] :: SoCs evolved from MPUs by integrating GPU, modem, and memory controller on-die
[[LxUj37D3|discrete]] :: discrete GPUs offer higher throughput but consume far more power and board space
