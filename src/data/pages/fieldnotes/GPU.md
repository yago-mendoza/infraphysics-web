A massively parallel processor optimized for throughput over latency. Thousands of simple cores execute the same instruction on different data (SIMD/SIMT). Originally designed for rendering, now critical for [[ML]] training and inference. Available as [[GPU//discrete]] add-in cards or [[GPU//integrated]] units sharing the [[chip//SoC]] die with the [[CPU]].
