- Take a [[2oNdlB5L|pre-trained]] model, train further on task-specific data
- Full fine-tuning updates all weights — expensive, risks catastrophic forgetting
- [[3kgsj4Y4|LoRA]] and adapters make it cheaper: freeze most weights, train a small delta
- The bridge between general knowledge and specific skill
