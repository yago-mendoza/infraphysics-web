Printed circuit board — the fiberglass-and-copper substrate that mechanically supports and electrically connects [[chip]] components via etched traces. Design tools: KiCad, Altium. Manufacturing involves layer stackup, drilling, plating, solder mask, and silkscreen. A [[chip//MCU]] or [[chip//MPU]] sits on the PCB alongside passives (resistors, capacitors), connectors, and power regulation. Board complexity ranges from 2-layer hobbyist to 20+ layer server motherboards.
