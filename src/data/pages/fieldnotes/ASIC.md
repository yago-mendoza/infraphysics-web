Application-specific integrated circuit — a chip designed for exactly one task. Unlike a general-purpose [[CPU]] or programmable [[component//chip//MCU]], an ASIC's logic is frozen at [[manufacturing//fab]] time. Delivers maximum throughput per watt for fixed workloads: Bitcoin mining, video encoding, network packet processing. [[ML//TPU]] is a category of ML-focused ASIC. Design cost is high, so ASICs only make sense at volume.
