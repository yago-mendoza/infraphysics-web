- Semiconductor fabrication facility (foundry) that manufactures [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] dies from silicon wafers
- Process nodes (TSMC 3nm, Samsung 4nm, Intel 18A) define transistor density and power efficiency
- Fabrication involves hundreds of lithography, etching, deposition, and doping steps
- Foundries like TSMC produce [[6YzJQiig|ASIC]], [[trkh9gwv|SoC]], [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]], and [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] dies for fabless companies
- Fab cost exceeds $20B for leading-edge nodes
- Main foundries: TSMC, Samsung, Intel
- [[QSPGKDnh|sensor]]s don't require the latest node (e.g. Apple ⟶ BOSCH for sensors, no 3nm needed)
