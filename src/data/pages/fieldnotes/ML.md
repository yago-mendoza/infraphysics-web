Machine learning — algorithms that improve through data rather than explicit programming. Training runs on [[GPU]] clusters or [[ML//TPU]] accelerators; inference can happen on cloud GPUs, edge [[ML//NPU]] cores, or even [[chip//MCU]] devices via [[ML//TinyML]]. The boundary between software and hardware blurs as ML models get baked into silicon.
