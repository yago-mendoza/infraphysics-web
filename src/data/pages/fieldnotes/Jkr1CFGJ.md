- Microprocessor unit — a [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] containing only the [[Z9W6rweD|core]] (and caches)
- Requires external [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]], storage, and peripheral chips on the [[26t2rDup|PCB]]
- Desktop and server processors (Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Apple M-series) are MPUs
- Modern ones are blurring into [[trkh9gwv|SoC]] territory by integrating GPU, NPU, and memory controllers on-package

[[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] :: external DRAM required — MPUs lack on-die memory, relying on DDR modules via memory bus
[[trkh9gwv|SoC]] :: modern MPUs are converging with SoCs as they integrate GPU, NPU, and memory controllers
