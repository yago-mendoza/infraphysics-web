Machine learning inference on microcontrollers ([[component//chip//MCU]]) and ultra-low-power devices — models measured in kilobytes, running on [[ARM//cortex-M]] cores with sub-milliwatt budgets. Frameworks: TensorFlow Lite Micro, Edge Impulse. Use cases: keyword spotting, anomaly detection, gesture recognition. Bypasses cloud latency and connectivity requirements by keeping data and inference entirely on-device.
