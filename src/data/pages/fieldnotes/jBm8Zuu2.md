- Volatile storage providing nanosecond-latency read/write for running programs
- The OS partitions physical RAM into [[xYh5GUtH|kernel space]] (privileged, hardware-facing) and [[oCOADRq6|user space]] (application sandboxes)
- Bandwidth and latency dominate performance in data-intensive tasks — [[oInUhOGM|architecture]] addresses this with wide buses and high-bandwidth memory
- Embedded systems often use SRAM on-chip inside a [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]]
- On iPhones, RAM is stacked ON the [[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]] package (tiny footprint)
- Windows allows RAM upgrading; macOS does not (RAM inside [[Jkr1CFGJ|MPU]] package)
