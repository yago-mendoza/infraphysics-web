ARM's microcontroller profile [[CPU//core]] family — optimized for low power, low cost, and deterministic real-time behavior. The heart of most modern [[component//chip//MCU]] devices. Variants range from Cortex-M0 (tiny, 12K gates) to Cortex-M55 (with Helium vector extensions for [[ML//TinyML]]). Executes Thumb-2 instructions, has a nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC), and runs bare-metal or RTOS.
