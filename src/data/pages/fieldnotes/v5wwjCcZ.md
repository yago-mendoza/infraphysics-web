- Google's text-to-image model family. Imagen (2022), Imagen 2 (2023), Imagen 3 (2024)
- Architecture: T5-XXL text encoder → cascading diffusion upsampling (64 → 256 → 1024 resolution)
- Key finding: scaling the text encoder matters more than scaling the image model — language understanding drives image quality
- Less open than [[ZY388cmd|Stable Diffusion]] but competitive. Google's counterpart to [[oZeWLvGF|DALL-E]]
