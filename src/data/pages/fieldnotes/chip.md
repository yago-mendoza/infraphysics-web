A monolithic piece of silicon carrying integrated circuits. Categories include [[chip//MCU]] (microcontroller — CPU + memory + peripherals), [[chip//MPU]] (microprocessor — CPU only, needs external memory), and [[chip//SoC]] (system-on-chip — heterogeneous integration of CPU, GPU, NPU, modems). The line between them blurs as integration density rises with each [[manufacturing//fab]] node shrink.
