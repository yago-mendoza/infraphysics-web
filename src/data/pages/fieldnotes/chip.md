A monolithic piece of silicon carrying integrated circuits. Categories include [[chip//MCU]] (microcontroller — CPU + memory + peripherals), [[chip//MPU]] (microprocessor — CPU only, needs external memory), and [[chip//SoC]] (system-on-chip — heterogeneous integration of CPU, GPU, NPU, modems). The line between them blurs as integration density rises with each [[manufacturing//fab]] node shrink.
[[chip//MCU]] :: self-contained — integrates CPU, memory, and peripherals on one die for embedded control
[[chip//MPU]] :: CPU-only — requires external memory and peripherals, trades integration for raw performance
[[chip//SoC]] :: heterogeneous — packs CPU, GPU, NPU, and modem onto one die for mobile and edge computing
[[semiconductor]] :: the material foundation — doped silicon with billions of transistors per die
[[hardware]] :: chips are the building blocks of all physical computing systems
