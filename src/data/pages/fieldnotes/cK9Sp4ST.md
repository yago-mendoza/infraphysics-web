- A distributed ledger replicated across many nodes — no single point of failure
- Docker network = physical transport layer (the road); blockchain = application layer (the club with rules)
- Same Chain ID → same blockchain, regardless of physical infrastructure (different machines, different Docker networks)
- Every node independently verifies every transaction — trust through verification, not authority

[[N8SypUVq|Blockchain Node]] :: nodes are the participants that store, verify, and propagate the ledger
