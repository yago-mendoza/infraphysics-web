An external or on-chip hardware block that extends a processor's capabilities — timers, UARTs, SPI, I2C, ADC, DAC, PWM controllers. In embedded development, peripherals are the interface between digital logic and the physical world. Popular development platforms like [[peripheral//STM32]] and [[peripheral//ESP32]] provide rich peripheral sets accessible via [[I/O//MMIO]] registers.
