- A massively parallel processor — optimized for throughput over latency
- Thousands of simple cores executing the same instruction on different data (SIMD/SIMT)
- Originally designed for rendering, now critical for [[7aLJOACt|ML]] training and inference
- Available as [[LxUj37D3|discrete]] add-in cards or [[a2FkPabO|integrated]] units sharing the [[trkh9gwv|SoC]] die with the [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]]
