A reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture licensed by Arm Holdings. Dominates mobile, embedded, and increasingly server workloads due to power efficiency. Unlike x86, ARM licenses its instruction set to third parties — [[chip//SoC]] vendors like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung design their own cores around it. Three main profile families target different compute tiers.
