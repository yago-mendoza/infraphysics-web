- Microsoft's approach: build a knowledge graph from documents, then query the graph alongside [[TIQNpwbS|vector search]]
- Extracts entities and relationships, builds community summaries at multiple granularity levels
- Better for "global" questions requiring synthesis across many documents — where pure vector retrieval fails
- Open sourced (2024). One of the most popular RAG trends alongside [[OcTW3eWK|ColBERT]]/ColPali
