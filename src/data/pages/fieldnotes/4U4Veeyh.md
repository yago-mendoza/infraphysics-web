- Largest open code dataset (BigCode: HuggingFace + ServiceNow). The code companion to The Pile
- v1: 6.4 TB of permissively licensed code in 358 languages. v2: expanded, better deduplication

- The "[[Xe6SbANI|Common Crawl]] of code": same role for code models that Common Crawl plays for text LLMs
