- ARM's real-time profile [[Z9W6rweD|core]] family — deterministic, low-latency execution for safety-critical systems
- Found in automotive ECUs (braking, airbags), hard-drive controllers, and baseband modems
- Features tightly-coupled memory, dual-core lockstep (fault detection), and fast interrupt response
- Runs bare-metal or RTOS, not Linux
- Bridges the gap between [[OQmzx1Vg|Cortex-M]] and [[7wngT1lE|Cortex-A]]
