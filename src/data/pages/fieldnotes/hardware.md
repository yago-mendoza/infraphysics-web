The physical layer of computing — circuits, boards, and systems that execute software. Every abstraction in code ultimately resolves to electrons moving through [[semiconductor]] materials. A typical system stacks [[component//chip]] dies onto [[manufacturing//PCB]] boards, with [[CPU]] executing instructions, [[GPU]] handling parallel workloads, [[RAM]] providing volatile storage, and [[storage]] persisting data. The boundary between hardware and software blurs as [[manufacturing//firmware]] and [[ASIC]] designs encode logic that once lived in code.
[[component//chip]] :: the fundamental building block — packaged silicon dies containing integrated circuits
[[semiconductor]] :: the material foundation — doped silicon enables transistor switching
[[CPU]] :: executes sequential instruction streams — the core of general-purpose computation
[[GPU]] :: massively parallel processor for graphics, simulation, and ML workloads
[[RAM]] :: volatile working memory — fast but loses state on power loss
[[manufacturing//PCB]] :: the substrate that interconnects chips, power regulation, and I/O connectors
