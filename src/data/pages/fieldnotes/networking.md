The practice and infrastructure of connecting computing devices so they can exchange data. Encompasses physical media (copper, fiber, wireless), addressing schemes, and protocol stacks. Modern networking relies on packet switching and layered abstractions — from Ethernet frames to TCP segments to HTTP requests. [[networking//cache]] (CDN, proxy) reduces latency by serving repeated content from the edge instead of the origin.
