A semiconductor fabrication facility (foundry) that manufactures [[chip]] dies from silicon wafers. Process nodes (TSMC 3nm, Samsung 4nm, Intel 18A) define transistor density and power efficiency. Fabrication involves hundreds of lithography, etching, deposition, and doping steps. Foundries like TSMC produce [[ASIC]], [[chip//SoC]], [[CPU]], and [[GPU]] dies for fabless companies. Fab cost exceeds $20B for leading-edge nodes.
