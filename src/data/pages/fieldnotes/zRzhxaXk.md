- NVIDIA's [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] programming framework: C-like code that runs on thousands of cores in parallel
- The moat: PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX all depend on CUDA. AMD has ROCm, Intel has oneAPI, but the ecosystem lock-in is massive.
- Every ML training run, every inference call, every matrix multiply goes through CUDA
