- Generalization of [[ct4swTMy|chain of thought]]: explore multiple reasoning paths with lookahead and backtracking
- Instead of one linear chain, generate a tree of possibilities and evaluate branches before committing
- Trades more compute for better accuracy on planning, search, and multi-step reasoning
- Precursor idea to [[Kp4jIz9L|reasoning models]] — tree search at inference time
