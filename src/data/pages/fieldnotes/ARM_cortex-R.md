ARM's real-time profile [[CPU//core]] family — deterministic, low-latency execution for safety-critical systems. Found in automotive ECUs (braking, airbags), hard-drive controllers, and baseband modems. Features tightly-coupled memory, dual-core lockstep (fault detection), and fast interrupt response. Runs bare-metal or RTOS, not Linux. Bridges the gap between [[ARM//cortex-M]] and [[ARM//cortex-A]].
