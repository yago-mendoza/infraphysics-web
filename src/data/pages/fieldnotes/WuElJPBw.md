- You Only Look Once: real-time object detection in a single forward pass — no region proposals
- Redmon et al. (2016). Now up to YOLOv11, lineage fragmented across maintainers post-v5
- Still the default for real-time production: robotics, surveillance, autonomous driving
- DETR (transformer-based) catches up academically but YOLO dominates deployment

[[G1JW8o79|CNN]] :: YOLO is fundamentally a CNN architecture — single-shot detection via convolutional feature maps, though newer versions incorporate transformer components
