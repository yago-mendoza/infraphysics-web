- Espressif's Wi-Fi + Bluetooth [[trkh9gwv|SoC]] family targeting IoT
- Integrates dual-core [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] (Xtensa or RISC-V), [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]], flash, radio, and [[PrATEjcr|peripheral]] blocks (ADC, SPI, I2C, PWM)
- Programmed via ESP-IDF (FreeRTOS-based) or Arduino
- Popular for [[uuLCFmtk|smart sensor]] gateways, home automation, and [[2mR18V1b|TinyML]] edge devices
- Low cost (~$2-5); the default prototyping platform for connected hardware
- MCU + Radio Transceiver (includes Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee); great for IoT
- Arduino (comes with the PCB) is used to learn embedded development
