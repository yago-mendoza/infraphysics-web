- "Let's think step by step." — prompt the model to show reasoning before the answer
- Wei et al. (2022): dramatically improves math, logic, multi-step reasoning
- Works because intermediate tokens give the model more computation per problem
- Tree-of-thought generalizes it to branching exploration of multiple reasoning paths
