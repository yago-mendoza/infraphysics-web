- NVIDIA's [[X0GHHYNe|microcomputer]] platform built around the [[58TuBQEb|Orin]] [[trkh9gwv|SoC]] ([[7wngT1lE|Cortex-A]] cores + hardwired Ampere [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]])
- Multiple Orins on a [[26t2rDup|PCB]] connected via NVLink for scaled-out edge compute
- CUDA enables deterministic programming of the [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] cores
- Educational and industrial; used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and edge [[7aLJOACt|ML]]
