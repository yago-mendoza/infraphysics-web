- A [[QSPGKDnh|sensor]] with on-board signal conditioning, ADC, and a small processor (often [[OQmzx1Vg|Cortex-M]]) on the same die or package
- Outputs calibrated digital data over I2C/SPI instead of raw analog voltage
- Examples: MEMS accelerometers (Bosch BMA400), environmental sensors (BME680)
- Offloads filtering and fusion from the host [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]], reducing [[zS3Nqz7G|I/O]] traffic and [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] load
