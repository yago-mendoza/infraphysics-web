- Material whose electrical conductivity falls between a conductor and an insulator — most commonly silicon
- Selective doping creates P-N junctions that form transistors — the fundamental switching elements of all digital and analog electronics
- The [[ZzRsypXy|fab]] process etches billions of transistors onto wafers to produce [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] dies
- Moore's Law has driven exponential scaling for decades, from micron-scale features to sub-3nm process nodes
