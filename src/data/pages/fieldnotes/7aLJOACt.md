- Algorithms that improve through data rather than explicit programming
- Training runs on [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] clusters or [[t8sPNl54|TPU]] accelerators
- Inference can happen on cloud GPUs, edge [[1yDGHLLU|NPU]] cores, or even [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] devices via [[2mR18V1b|TinyML]]
- The boundary between software and hardware blurs as ML models get baked into silicon
