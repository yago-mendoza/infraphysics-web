- Add noise step by step until pure static, then train a [[YrmsQuhU|neural net]] to reverse the process
- Generation = iterative denoising from random noise
- Stable training (no [[bKPquVKV|mode collapse]]), high-quality outputs, but slow inference (many steps)

[[JP0VCiWq|GAN]] :: diffusion replaced GANs for image generation — more stable training, better quality, but orders of magnitude slower
