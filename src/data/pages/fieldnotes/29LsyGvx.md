- OpenAI, June 2018. 117M parameters. The first GPT.
- Decoder-only transformer, [[2oNdlB5L|pre-trained]] on books then [[qcqxPFA0|fine-tuned]] for specific tasks
- I played with it in the OpenAI developer console — it just continued text, nothing more. But you could feel the potential: coherent sentences, sometimes surprising connections.
