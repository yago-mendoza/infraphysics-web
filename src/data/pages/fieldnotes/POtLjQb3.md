- Parasitic state in a [[MTfcKkH5|chip]] that doesn't reach full short-circuit but draws infinite current ⟶ drains the battery
- Triggered by overvoltage: electromagnetic pulse ⟶ copper traces act as antennas ⟶ voltage spike ⟶ parasitic thyristor locks on
- Critical concern in aerospace; airplanes are exposed to radiation and electromagnetic interference that can trigger latch-up in unshielded electronics
