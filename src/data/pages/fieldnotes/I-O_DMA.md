Direct memory access — a hardware engine that copies data between [[RAM]] and peripherals without [[CPU]] intervention. The CPU programs source/dest addresses and length, then the DMA controller handles the transfer while the CPU does other work. Critical for high-throughput I/O: disk, network, audio, and [[GPU//discrete]] PCIe transfers. Embedded [[chip//MCU]] DMA channels service ADC, SPI, and UART buffers.
