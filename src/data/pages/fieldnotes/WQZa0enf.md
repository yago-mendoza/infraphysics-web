- Cryptocurrency wallet = key management software — doesn't "store" coins, coins live on-chain
- Evolution: [[2HSHagKF|keystore]] files (per-account backup) → [[kQcY7a5n|HD wallets]] (single seed backup)
- Keystore era: each account had its own encrypted file — lose one file = lose that account forever
- HD wallet era: one seed phrase → all accounts — lose the device, not the keys
