A small, ultra-fast storage cell inside the [[CPU//core]] — typically 32 or 64 bits wide. Registers hold operands for the [[CPU//ALU]], return addresses, stack pointers, and status flags. ARM architectures expose 16–31 general-purpose registers; x86 has historically fewer, relying more on stack and memory. Register pressure directly affects compiler optimization quality.
