- A [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]] core embedded on the same die (or package) as the [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]], sharing system [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] instead of dedicated VRAM
- Found in every laptop APU, mobile [[trkh9gwv|SoC]], and Apple Silicon
- Lower power and bandwidth than [[LxUj37D3|discrete]]
- Zero-copy data sharing with the CPU simplifies programming and cuts latency for lightweight graphics and [[1yDGHLLU|NPU]]-style inference tasks
