- Cryptographic primitives that make blockchain trustless: signing, verification, hashing
- Key pairs generated entirely off-chain — no blockchain connection needed
- Probability of two keys colliding is astronomically low (2^256 keyspace)
- The private key is the master secret — everything else (public key, address) derives from it
