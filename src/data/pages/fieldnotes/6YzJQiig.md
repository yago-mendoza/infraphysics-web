- Application-specific integrated circuit — a chip designed for exactly one task
- Unlike a general-purpose [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] or programmable [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]], an ASIC's logic is frozen at [[ZzRsypXy|fab]] time
- Delivers maximum throughput per watt for fixed workloads — Bitcoin mining, video encoding, network packet processing
- [[t8sPNl54|TPU]] is a category of ML-focused ASIC
- Design cost is high, so ASICs only make sense at volume
- Common ASICs found inside [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]]s and [[trkh9gwv|SoC]]s: [[t8sPNl54|TPU]], NIC, [[1yDGHLLU|NPU]], DSP, [[WEUTQwqv|GPU]], ISP
- Math embedded as silicon: `y = mx + n` computed on-circuit with no instruction overhead
- DSP: soundwave ⟶ spectrogram (filters noise via Fourier Transforms)
- Narrow, task-custom-made; attached to the silicon, only does one thing
- Google's [[t8sPNl54|TPU]]s are ASICs (no core intelligence, pure matrix math)
