- Application-specific integrated circuit — a chip designed for exactly one task
- Unlike a general-purpose [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] or programmable [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]], an ASIC's logic is frozen at [[ZzRsypXy|fab]] time
- Delivers maximum throughput per watt for fixed workloads — Bitcoin mining, video encoding, network packet processing
- [[t8sPNl54|TPU]] is a category of ML-focused ASIC
- Design cost is high, so ASICs only make sense at volume
