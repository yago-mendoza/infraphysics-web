The arithmetic logic unit — the combinational circuit inside a [[CPU//core]] that performs integer addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR/XOR, and shifts. Floating-point math typically lives in a separate FPU. Modern cores have multiple ALUs executing in parallel, fed by the out-of-order scheduler. The ALU's result is written back to a [[CPU//register]].
