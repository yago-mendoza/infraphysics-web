- BFL (Black Forest Labs, ex-Stability AI researchers). Flux [schnell|dev|pro] — the next-gen after [[ZY388cmd|Stable Diffusion]]
- Built on [[L7lWic03|DiT]] architecture. Among the highest-quality open-weight image models as of 2024
- Three tiers: schnell (fast, distilled), dev (full quality, open weights), pro (commercial API)
- The practical default: most image generation workflows in 2024–2025 run Flux or SD3, not DALL-E or Imagen

[[ZY388cmd|Stable Diffusion]] :: Flux is SD's spiritual successor — same research team (Rombach et al.), rebuilt on DiT instead of U-Net
