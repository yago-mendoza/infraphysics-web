- Stanford NLP framework: program (not prompt) language models — treat prompts as compiled, optimizable programs
- Define signatures (input→output), compose modules, optimize via few-shot examples or metrics
- Core idea: humans are terrible zero-shot prompters, so let the system optimize prompts automatically
- Represents the "automatic prompt engineering" direction — prompts as code, not prose
