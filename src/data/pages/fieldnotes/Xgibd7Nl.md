- Fast buffer (usually DRAM or SLC flash) between the host and the storage medium
- Write-back caches acknowledge writes before they reach the platter/NAND — boosting throughput at the cost of a power-loss risk window
- Read caches keep hot blocks in memory to avoid mechanical seek or flash read latency
- Layers include the OS page cache, drive internal DRAM, and ZFS's ARC
- Same principle as [[rItXgdUN|cache]] (nanoseconds) and [[Q1kGheNp|cache]] (milliseconds), applied at the microsecond scale
