Microprocessor unit — a [[chip]] containing only the [[CPU//core]] (and caches), requiring external [[RAM]], storage, and peripheral chips on the [[manufacturing//PCB]]. Desktop and server processors (Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Apple M-series) are MPUs, though modern ones are blurring into [[chip//SoC]] territory by integrating GPU, NPU, and memory controllers on-package.
