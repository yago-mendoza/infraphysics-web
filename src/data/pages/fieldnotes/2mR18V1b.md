- ML inference on microcontrollers ([[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]]) and ultra-low-power devices
- Models measured in kilobytes, running on [[OQmzx1Vg|Cortex-M]] cores with sub-milliwatt budgets
- Frameworks: TensorFlow Lite Micro, Edge Impulse
- Use cases: keyword spotting, anomaly detection, gesture recognition
- Bypasses cloud latency and connectivity requirements by keeping data and inference entirely on-device
