- Direct memory access — a hardware engine that copies data between [[jBm8Zuu2|RAM]] and peripherals without [[OkJJJyxX|CPU]] intervention
- The CPU programs source/dest addresses and length, then the DMA controller handles the transfer independently
- Critical for high-throughput I/O — disk, network, audio, and [[LxUj37D3|discrete]] PCIe transfers
- Embedded [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] DMA channels service ADC, SPI, and UART buffers
