- Capabilities that appear suddenly at scale — arithmetic, chain-of-thought reasoning, translation to unseen languages
- Not present in small models, then "switch on" past a compute threshold
- Controversial: Wei et al. (2022) catalogued them, but Schaeffer et al. (2023) argued it's a mirage of metric choice
