The physical processes that turn a chip design into a packaged, testable product. Spans wafer [[manufacturing//fab]] (lithography, etching, doping), [[manufacturing//PCB]] assembly (soldering components onto boards), and [[manufacturing//firmware]] flashing (writing initial software into non-volatile memory). Each stage introduces yield and reliability constraints.
