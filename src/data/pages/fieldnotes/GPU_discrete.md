A standalone [[GPU]] on its own PCB with dedicated GDDR/HBM memory, connected to the host [[CPU]] via PCIe or NVLink. Delivers maximum compute throughput for [[ML]] training, rendering, and HPC. Power draw ranges from 75W (entry) to 700W+ (datacenter). Data must be explicitly transferred between host [[RAM]] and device memory, adding latency but offering massive bandwidth on-card.
