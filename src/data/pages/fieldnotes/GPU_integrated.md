A [[GPU]] core embedded on the same die (or package) as the [[CPU]], sharing system [[RAM]] instead of dedicated VRAM. Found in every laptop APU, mobile [[chip//SoC]], and Apple Silicon. Lower power and bandwidth than [[GPU//discrete]], but zero-copy data sharing with the CPU simplifies programming and cuts latency for lightweight graphics and [[ML//NPU]]-style inference tasks.
