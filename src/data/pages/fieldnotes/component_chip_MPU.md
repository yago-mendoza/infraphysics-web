Microprocessor unit — a [[component//chip]] containing only the [[CPU//core]] (and caches), requiring external [[RAM]], storage, and peripheral chips on the [[manufacturing//PCB]]. Desktop and server processors (Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Apple M-series) are MPUs, though modern ones are blurring into [[component//chip//SoC]] territory by integrating GPU, NPU, and memory controllers on-package.
[[component//chip]] :: parent category — MPUs are the traditional discrete processor, CPU-only silicon
[[CPU//core]] :: the MPU's sole payload — high-performance cores with deep pipelines and large caches
[[RAM]] :: external DRAM required — MPUs lack on-die memory, relying on DDR modules via memory bus
[[manufacturing//PCB]] :: MPUs need a full board ecosystem with discrete power delivery, memory, and I/O
[[component//chip//SoC]] :: modern MPUs are converging with SoCs as they integrate GPU, NPU, and memory controllers
