- DeepMind (Hoffmann et al., 2022): most LLMs were undertrained relative to their size
- Given a fixed compute budget, use more data with fewer parameters than previously thought
- Chinchilla 70B matched Gopher 280B by training on 4× more tokens
- Shifted the industry from "bigger model" to "more data, right-sized model"
