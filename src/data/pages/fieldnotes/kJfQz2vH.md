- Training across multiple [[WEUTQwqv|GPUs]]/nodes
- Data parallelism: same model on every GPU, split the batch. Model parallelism: split the model across GPUs. Pipeline parallelism: split by layer.
- Communication overhead is the bottleneck — NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects matter as much as the GPUs themselves
