- Nvidia's agent architecture (2023): curriculum (progressive tasks), skill library (reusable code), sandbox (verification)
- The agent writes JavaScript functions as skills, stores them, and composes them for new tasks — demonstrated in Minecraft
- Key insight: skill library = agent workflow memory. Build on past successes instead of re-deriving solutions
- More abstractly: curriculum drives exploration, skill library is persistent memory, sandbox prevents catastrophic failures
