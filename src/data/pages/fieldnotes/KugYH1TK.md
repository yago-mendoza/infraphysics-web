- Dedicated models trained to produce dense vector representations optimized for retrieval
- SentenceTransformers, OpenAI embeddings, Nomic Embed, Jina v3 — each tuned for semantic similarity
- Matryoshka [[haA3MDhG|embeddings]]: train once, truncate vectors to any dimension — flexible quality/cost tradeoff
- Evaluated on MTEB leaderboard (known overfitting, but still the de-facto benchmark)
