- Google's competitive programming model. AlphaCode (2022) and AlphaCode 2 (2023) — human-competitive on Codeforces
- Core technique: generate massive candidate pool (millions), then filter and cluster — brute force + selection
- AlphaCodeium (open): flow engineering — iterative test generation, execution, refinement around a base model
- The lesson: multi-step pipelines around a model can dramatically boost coding performance beyond the model alone
