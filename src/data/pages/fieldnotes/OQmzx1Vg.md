- ARM's microcontroller profile [[Z9W6rweD|core]] family — optimized for low power, low cost, and deterministic real-time behavior
- The heart of most modern [[gKR2I1Nu|MCU]] devices
- Variants range from Cortex-M0 (tiny, 12K gates) to Cortex-M55 (with Helium vector extensions for [[2mR18V1b|TinyML]])
- Executes Thumb-2 instructions, has a nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC), and runs bare-metal or RTOS
