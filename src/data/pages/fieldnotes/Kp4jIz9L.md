- Models trained to "think" before answering via extended [[ct4swTMy|chain of thought]]
- o1 (OpenAI, Sep 2024): first frontier reasoning model. Uses RL on CoT, likely with process reward models
- R1 ([[nUKlfmSO|DeepSeek]], Jan 2025): open-weight, matched o1 via [[HRgl17gQ|GRPO]] — no [[qcqxPFA0|SFT]] needed
- The paradigm (o1, o3, R1, QwQ) dominates 2025. Core insight: more test-time compute = better answers
