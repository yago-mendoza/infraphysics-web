# markdown reference

this log documents every markdown pattern supported by the build system.

## text formatting

regular paragraph text flows naturally. you can use **bold text** for emphasis, *italic text* for subtle emphasis, and ~~strikethrough~~ for corrections or deprecations. combine them for ***bold and italic*** when needed.

## lists

unordered list:
- first item
- second item
- third item with more detail

ordered list:
1. step one
2. step two
3. step three

## links

inline links work like this: [infraphysics home](https://infraphysics.net) or reference external resources like [github](https://github.com).

## blockquotes

> "the best code is no code at all."
> — every senior engineer eventually

nested quotes work too:

> outer quote
> > inner quote

## code

inline code uses backticks: `const x = 42;`

code blocks use triple backticks:

```javascript
function entropy(system) {
  return system.disorder / system.order;
}
```

```python
def measure_friction(task_a, task_b):
    return abs(task_a.context - task_b.context)
```

## tables

| metric | value | unit |
|--------|-------|------|
| latency | 12 | ms |
| throughput | 450 | req/s |
| error rate | 0.02 | % |

## images with positioning

standard image (full width by default):

some more text after a standard image.

**side-by-side layout** (text on same block as image, no blank line between):

this text is **vertically centered** beside the image.
multiple lines become multiple paragraphs.
the image is on the right, text on the left.

back to normal flow after an empty line.

image on the left, text on the right.
supports *inline* formatting like **bold** and [links](https://example.com).
each line is a separate paragraph.

normal paragraph after the side-by-side section.

this concludes the markdown reference. all patterns above are processed by the build system and rendered as html.
