Microcontroller unit — a self-contained [[chip]] integrating a [[CPU//core]] (often ARM Cortex-M), flash memory, [[RAM]], and [[peripheral]] blocks (timers, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C) on a single die. Runs bare-metal or RTOS code. Examples: [[peripheral//STM32]] (STMicro), [[peripheral//ESP32]] (Espressif). MCUs dominate IoT, automotive, and industrial control where cost, power, and determinism matter more than raw speed.
