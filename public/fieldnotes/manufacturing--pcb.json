{"content":"<p>Printed circuit board — the fiberglass-and-copper substrate that mechanically supports and electrically connects <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"component//chip\">chip</a> components via etched traces. Design tools: KiCad, Altium. Manufacturing involves layer stackup, drilling, plating, solder mask, and silkscreen. A <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"component//chip//MCU\">MCU</a> or <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"component//chip//MPU\">MPU</a> sits on the PCB alongside passives (resistors, capacitors), connectors, and power regulation. Board complexity ranges from 2-layer hobbyist to 20+ layer server motherboards.</p>\n"}
