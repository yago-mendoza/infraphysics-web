{"content":"<p>A fast buffer (usually DRAM or SLC flash) between the host and the storage medium. Write-back caches acknowledge writes before they reach the platter/NAND, boosting throughput at the cost of a power-loss risk window. Read caches keep hot blocks in memory to avoid mechanical seek or flash read latency. The OS page cache, the drive&#39;s internal DRAM, and ZFS&#39;s ARC are all layers of storage caching. Same principle as <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"CPU//cache\">cache</a> (nanoseconds) and <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"networking//cache\">cache</a> (milliseconds), applied at the microsecond scale.</p>\n"}
