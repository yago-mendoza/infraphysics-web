{"content":"<p>The arithmetic logic unit — the combinational circuit inside a <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"CPU//core\">core</a> that performs integer addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR/XOR, and shifts. Floating-point math typically lives in a separate FPU. Modern cores have multiple ALUs executing in parallel, fed by the out-of-order scheduler. The ALU&#39;s result is written back to a <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"CPU//register\">register</a>.</p>\n"}
