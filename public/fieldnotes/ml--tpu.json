Uses a systolic array architecture to stream matrix operations with minimal memory access. TPU v4 pods interconnect thousands of chips via custom high-bandwidth networks. Exposed as cloud instances (Google Cloud TPU). Represents the extreme end of ML hardware specialization.\n<a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"ASIC\">ASIC</a>\n<a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"ML\">ML</a></p>\n"}
