{"content":"<p>Small, fast SRAM sitting between the <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"CPU//core\">core</a> and main <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"RAM\">RAM</a>. Organized in levels: L1 (per-core, ~4 cycles), L2 (per-core or shared, ~12 cycles), L3 (shared across cores, ~40 cycles). The cache hierarchy exploits temporal and spatial locality — most programs re-access the same data and nearby addresses repeatedly. Cache misses stall the pipeline and dominate performance on memory-bound workloads. Compare with <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"storage//cache\">cache</a> (disk-level) and <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"networking//cache\">cache</a> (CDN/proxy-level) — same principle, different latency scale.</p>\n"}
