{"content":"<p>A material whose electrical conductivity falls between a conductor and an insulator — most commonly silicon. By selectively doping regions with impurities, engineers create P-N junctions that form transistors, the fundamental switching elements of all digital and analog electronics. The <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"manufacturing//fab\">fab</a> process etches billions of these transistors onto wafers to produce <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"component//chip\">chip</a> dies. Moore&#39;s Law has driven exponential scaling for decades, pushing from micron-scale features to sub-3nm process nodes.</p>\n"}
