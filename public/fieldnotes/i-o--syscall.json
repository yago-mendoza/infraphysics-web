{"content":"<p>A system call — the controlled gate between <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"RAM//user space\">user space</a> and <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"RAM//kernel space\">kernel space</a>. When a process needs hardware access (read file, send packet, allocate memory), it traps into the kernel via a syscall instruction. The kernel validates arguments, performs the operation, and returns. Syscall overhead (context switch + TLB flush) motivates batching APIs (io_uring, sendmmsg) and <a class=\"wiki-ref\" data-address=\"I/O//DMA\">DMA</a> for bulk transfers.</p>\n"}
